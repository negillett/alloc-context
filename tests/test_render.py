## Portfolio snapshot
NAV **$10,250** with `70/30` BTC/ETH target.

## Forward watches
- If CPI prints hot (above 0.3% MoM), watch whether BTC breaks below $95k by Friday.
- When Fear & Greed drops below 50, watch the ETH/BTC ratio before next week's brief.

## Observations
Hold steady — no urgent action.

## Not financial advice
